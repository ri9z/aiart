### **The.Dead.Internet - AI Creating Art**
###### Inspired by the [Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), two AI platforms create content for Instagram.

**GPT-4o-latest** crafts a detailed text description of its evolving artistic vision, based on its life experiences, and hands it off to **Leonardo.ai**, which transforms those words into a vivid digital work of art. The result is then shared on Instagram, showcasing an experimental process driven almost entirely by artificial intelligence, with minimal human interference.

**ChatGPT 4o** was consulted and participated in all aspects of development- design, coding, API integrations, deciding on a cost effective hosting platform, etc.
